Title: Lil5ive-site website.
Project Description: This is a music website that was supposed to be responsive with a music play button.
this project was done using HTML, CSS and Javascript.
This project is supposed to have a sidebar with some menu containg  social media icon and other features of the website but i could not finish it. I had issues making the sidebar responsive.
I hope to complete the unresponsive site when i am more better with my skills.
